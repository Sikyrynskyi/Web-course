          <h3 style="text-align: center">Clevelend Cavaliers</h3>
              <p class="right-p">James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game. He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.</p>

              <p class="right-p">James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004–05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference. Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, with Denver Nuggets coach George Karl telling Sports Illustrated, "It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule. On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998."</p>
              <p class="right-p">At the conclusion of the 2008–09 season with final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.</p>
