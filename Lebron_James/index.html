      <h1>Lebron James</h1>
      <p class="par">LeBron Raymone James Sr.(born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Often considered the best basketball player in the world and regarded by some as the greatest player of all time, James' NBA accomplishments are extensive and include four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, two Olympic gold medals, three All-Star Game MVP awards, and an NBA scoring title. He is the all-time NBA playoffs scoring leader and has amassed fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, twelve All-NBA First Team designations, and five All-Defensive First Team honors.</p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 30px;">Early life</h1>
          <img id="kid" src="download.jpg" width="30%" >
        <p style="width: 50%; margin-left: 100px;font-size: 17px;"><br>James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James. His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in their life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.</p>
          <p style="width: 50%; margin-left: 100px;font-size: 17px;"><br>James started playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. The group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school together. In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincentâ€“St. Mary High School, a predominantly white private Catholic school.<br><br><br><br></p>
      <h1>Player profile</h1>
          <p class="par">Standing 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), James has started at small forward and power forward, but he can also play the other three positions. His athletic and versatile playing style has drawn comparisons to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. James's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Many basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his second year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season.</p>

          <p class="par">With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, but he has twice finished second in the voting and lists the award as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals nine times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well, but his team was defeated by superior competition.</p>
